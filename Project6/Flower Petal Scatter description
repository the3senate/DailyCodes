The Flower Petal Scatter beam is a defensive beam used for accurate target destruction, such as missiles or large asteroids.  The equations
for the beam are ship_x + t * 2 + 8 and ship_y + t * 2 * sin(4*t) + 16.  In both equations, t * 2 increases the wave's amplitude and
period over time, giving it useful side-defense lasers.  The ship_x, ship_y, +8, and +16 alter their vertical and horizontal shift,
causing the beam to fire close to the back of the ship, allowing the beam to defend from the side instead of just the front.  The sin(4*t) 
gives it a unique firing pattern, causing what appears to be beams that intersect at certain points in a flower-petal pattern.
